## Chapter 1: Energy and Power
- Energy is the **capacity to do work** or cause change.
- Power is the **rate** of energy transfer
- Energy = Power * Time
	- energy is Joules, power is Watts
- KE = 1/2 mv^2
- Energy density comparisons: For example, gasoline has much higher energy per unit mass than many alternatives. (In the chapter: “1 ton of gasoline releases about 15 times the energy of 1 ton of TNT.”
- A square mile of solar panels could produce as much power as a conventional power plant (depending on conditions) — showing scale issues in renewable energy.
- “Explosiveness” depends not just on total energy, but how quickly it is released (power) — fast release leads to damage; slow release is less destructive.

	- **No process is perfectly efficient: some energy is lost as heat**.

- Heat is _not_ the same as temperature; temperature is a measure of average molecular kinetic energy, while heat refers to energy transfer.
- - Because thermal expansion is proportional to initial size, large structures (bridges, skyscrapers) are more vulnerable to thermal stress than small objects.
- **❄️ Example Question:**
	- If you leave the refrigerator door open, does the room get colder or hotter after a while?
	- The room gets hotter overall.
	- The fridge’s compressor and coils work as a heat pump:
	- It moves heat from inside the fridge → to the back coils → then dumps it into the room.
	- The motor and compressor consume electrical energy, which turns into additional heat.
	- The energy that goes in (electricity) becomes 100 % heat eventually (from friction, inefficiency, etc.).
	- Even though cold air blows out the front, more heat is released at the back + motor = net heating.\

## Chapter 4: Radiation
- - Background radiation ≈ 300 mrem / year
- 1 Sv = 100 rem


## Chapter 5: Nuclear Power
- - Reactors are **heat engines** powered by **fission**.
- Efficiency limited by temperature difference.
- Even after shutdown, fission fragments continue decaying → _decay heat_.
