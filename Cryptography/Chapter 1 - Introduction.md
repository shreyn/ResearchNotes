## 1.1 What is Cryptography?
Cryptography is the mathematical science of designing secure communication systems in the presence of adversaries.
There are four different categories:
1. Confidentiality (the one we think of): ensuring only authorized parties can read info
2. Integrity: Ensuring data hasn't been tampered
3. Authentication: Proving the identity of the sender or receiver
4. Non-repudiation: Ensuring a sender cannot deny sending a message
#### Kerckhoffs's Principle
We must assume that the system itself is public, and only the key is private.

- Cryptanalysis: study of breaking down these systems
