## Refraction
- wave front (concentric circles)
- ray: arrow showing energy moving outward from center
	- if moving through a medium that has a slow and fast section, the ray can bend
		- **bends toward the slower region**
	- Light rays move slower in water
	- **fiber optic cables** have a gradient of slow region in the middle, fast regions on the edges, so light will always bend and stay in the center
- Energy propagation
	- waves carry energy, unless dissipated in thermal energy
	- How much energy will arrive at the receiver?
		- Depends on **dimensionality of the wave propagation**
	- Dilutes depending on the distance from the center (radius)
		- no dilution in 1D, dilution of $\frac{1}{r}$ in 2D, dilution of $\frac{1}{r^2}$ in 3D
- **Sound Channel in Ocean**:
	- There is a layer in ocean (thermocline layer) that has slowest sound velocity
	- This means that there is a "sound channel" in the ocean (sound stays in this layer)
	- This converts a 3D sound space into a 2D space, so the dilution is much less
	- This allowed the ping for downed aircraft
