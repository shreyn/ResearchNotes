## 1.1 Sets and Binary Operations
**Binary Operations**
- Binary operation on a set $S$ is a rule that takes any two elements $a, b \in S$, and returns another element in $S$.
$$* : S \times S \rightarrow S, \hspace{1em} (a,b) \rightarrow a * b$$
- Examples:
	- Addition on $\mathbb{Z}$: $a + b$
	- Matrix multiplication on 2 x 2 matrices
	- Minimum operation on a set: $\text{min}(a,b)$
- **closure is required!**: the output needs to be within the set.
	- So division on $\mathbb{Z}$ is not closed, since 3/2 = 1.5 $\not \in \mathbb{Z}$
## 1.2 What is an Group?
A group is a set and a binary operation that satisfies 4 properties. 
**Def:** A group is a pair $(G, *)$ of a set $G$ and a binary operation $*$ s.t.:
1. Closure:
	- For all $a,b \in G, a * b \in G$
2. Associativity:
	- For all $a,b,c \in G, (a*b)*c = a*(b*c)$
3. Identity Element:
	- $\exists e \in G$ s.t. $\forall a \in G, e*a = a*e = a$
	- Does nothing when combined with anything else
4. Inverses:
	- $\forall a \in G, \exists a^{-1} \in G$ s.t. $a*a^{-1} = e$
**Abelian Group**: Also commutative ($a*b = b*a$)
## 1.3 Symmetry Groups and $D_4$
We can make a group where it is made of transformations that preserve the shape of the figure.
Imagine a square with 4 corners. What movements can you do to the square so that it looks the same afterwards?
- 4 rotations, 4 reflections
#### Rotations
Lets label the four rotations as:
- $r_0$: identity (do nothing)
- $r_1$: rotate $90^o$ counterclockwise
- $r_2$: rotate 180
- $r_3$: rotate 270 counterclockwise
This forms a cyclic group of order 4, and:
$r_1^0 = r_0, r_1^1 = 1, \cdots$
- *basically, $r_1$ can "generate" all the rotations by raising it to different powers (repeating it)*
#### Reflections
4 lines of symmetry for a square:
- $f_v$: reflect over vertical axis
- $f_h$: reflect over horizontal
- $f_d$ reflect over main diagonal
- $f_{ad}$: reflect over anti-diagonal
Each revolution is an involution, meaning $f^2 = id$
- ie. if you flip twice, you get back to original square
### Binary Operation: Composition
To make this a group, we define the operation as:
$$a \cdot b = \text{do b first, then a}$$
- Just like function composition, and since function composition follows all the requirements for a group (closed, associative, identity, inverse), 
The set of all the symmetries with this operation forms a **group called: $D_4$ = dihedral group of order 8**
