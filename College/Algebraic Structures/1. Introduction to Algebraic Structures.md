## 1.1 Sets and Binary Operations
**Binary Operations**
- Binary operation on a set $S$ is a rule that takes any two elements $a, b \in S$, and returns another element in $S$.
$$* : S \times S \rightarrow S, \hspace{1em} (a,b) \rightarrow a * b$$
- Examples:
	- Addition on $\mathbb{Z}$: $a + b$
	- Matrix multiplication on 2 x 2 matrices
	- Minimum operation on a set: $\text{min}(a,b)$
- **closure is required!**: the output needs to be within the set.
