## 1.1 Sets and Binary Operations
**Binary Operations**
- Binary operation on a set $S$ is a rule that takes any two elements $a, b \in S$, and returns another element in $S$.
$$* : S \times S \rightarrow S, \hspace{1em} (a,b) \rightarrow a * b$$
- Examples:
	- Addition on $\mathbb{Z}$: $a + b$
	- Matrix multiplication on 2 x 2 matrices
	- Minimum operation on a set: $\text{min}(a,b)$
- **closure is required!**: the output needs to be within the set.
	- So division on $\mathbb{Z}$ is not closed, since 3/2 = 1.5 $\not \in \mathbb{Z}$
## 1.2 What is an Group?
A group is a set and a binary operation that satisfies 4 properties. 
**Def:** A group is a pair $(G, *)$ of a set $G$ and a binary operation $*$ s.t.:
1. Closure:
	- For all $a,b \in G, a * b \in G$
2. Associativity:
	- For all $a,b,c \in G, (a*b)*c = a*(b*c)$
3. Identity Element:
	- $\exists e \in G$ s.t. $\forall a \in G, e*a = a*e = a$
	- Does nothing when combined with anything else
4. Inverses:
	- $\forall a \in G, \exists a^{-1} \in G$ s.t. $a*a^{-1} = e$
**Abelian Group**: Also commutative ($a*b = b*a$)
